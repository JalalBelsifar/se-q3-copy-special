# This file is used to encrypt/decrypt all files in the soln directory.

# The .gitattributes file is documented in the gitattributes(5) man page. 
# The file pattern format is the same as the one used by .gitignore, 
# as documented in the gitignore(5) man page, with the exception that 
# specifying merely a directory (e.g. /dir/) is not sufficient to 
# encrypt all files beneath it.
# Also note that the pattern dir/* does not match files under sub-directories of dir/. 

# The second pattern is essential for ensuring that .gitattributes itself is not encrypted.
