# Copyspecial

You will complete functions inside of `copyspecial.py`. This program takes one or more directories as its arguments. A "special" file is defined as one where the name contains the pattern `__w__` somewhere, where the `w` is one or more word characters. The provided `main()` function includes code to parse the command line arguments, but the rest is up to you! Write functions to implement the features below and modify main() to call your functions.

Here are some suggested functions to create in your solution (details below):

*   `get_special_paths(dir)` &mdash; returns a list of the absolute paths of the special files in the given directory, but not deeper (no recursive search)
*   `copy_to(paths, dir)` &mdash; given a list of file paths, copies those files into the given directory
*   `zip_to(paths, zippath)` &mdash; given a list of file paths, zip those files up into the given zip path

## Part A - manipulating file paths

Gather a list of the absolute paths of the special files in all the directories. In the simplest case, just print that list (here, the `.` after the command is a single argument indicating the current directory). Print one absolute path per line.


    $ python copyspecial.py .
    /Users/daniel/Documents/github/kenzie/backend-copy-special-assessment/xyz__hello__.txt
    /Users/daniel/Documents/github/kenzie/backend-copy-special-assessment/zz__something__.jpg


We'll assume that names are not repeated across the directories (optional: check that assumption and error out if it's violated).

## Part B - file copying

If the `--todir dir` option is present on the command line, do not print anything. Instead, copy the files to the given directory, creating the directory if necessary. Use the `shutil` standard library module for file copying.

    $ python copyspecial.py --todir tmp/fooby .
    $ ls tmp/fooby
    xyz__hello__.txt        zz__something__.jpg

## Part C - calling an external program

If the `--tozip zipfile` option is present at the start of the command line, run this command: `zip -j zipfile <list all the files>` from within your code (the `subprocess` standard library module can help you with this). This will create a zipfile containing the files. Just for fun/reassurance, also print the command you are about to execute (e.g., `zip -j <zipfile> <each of the file paths>`). (Note to Windows users: Windows does not come with a program to produce standard .zip archives by default, but you can download the free `Zip` program [here](http://infozip.sourceforge.net/Zip.html).)

    $ python copyspecial.py --tozip tmp.zip .
    Command I'm going to do:  
    zip -j tmp.zip /Users/daniel/Documents/github/kenzie/backend-copy-special-assessment/xyz__hello__.txt /Users/daniel/Documents/github/kenzie/backend-copy-special-assessment/zz__something__.jpg

If the child process exits with an error code, your program should exit, displaying the error code and printing the command's output. Test this by trying to write a zip file to a directory that does not exist.

    $ python copyspecial.py --tozip /no/way.zip .
    Command I'm going to do:  
    zip -j /no/way.zip /Users/daniel/Documents/github/kenzie/backend-copy-special-assessment/xyz__hello__.txt /Users/daniel/Documents/github/kenzie/backend-copy-special-assessment/zz__something__.jpg
    
    zip I/O error: No such file or directory
    zip error: Could not create output file (/no/way.zip)

Notice the last two lines of output above e.g. `zip I/O error: No such file ...` This error message is generated by the zip utility itself, and is normally printed to the `sys.stderr` console device which is the same device as the regular `sys.stdout` used by print().  You should not hard-code this message yourself.  You may ask, 'But if I call zip as a child process, how can I flow this error text from the child process to my console device?' The answer is to surround your call to subprocess with a try/except block, and capture the exception that zip will generate as a child process.  Read about subprocess exceptions [here](https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html#exceptions).

The error text is contained within the exception instance, and you can retrieve it and print it.  You will need to read the documentation pages of `subprocess.run` or [`subprocess.check_output`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html#subprocess.check_output) to understand what kind of exception will be raised in this case, and how you should catch it.  YES the documentation is dense, but as a software engineer it is important to learn how to read and make sense of documentation no matter the density or sparsity.

## Guidelines
 - Use the `subprocess` library to launch `zip` directly as a command line utility from within your program
 - Don't use the `zipfile` library.
 - Your code style should be able to pass a PEP8 (flake8) test
 - Indents should be 4 **spaces** (not 2)
 - Variable names should be well chosen and meaningful and should be in *snake_case*
 - Include [docstrings](https://realpython.com/documenting-python-code/#documenting-your-python-code-base-using-docstrings) as the first line of a function
 
## Testing with Unittest
This assignment also has separate unit tests to help you during development. The unit tests are located in the `tests` folder; you should not modify these.  Make sure all unit tests are passing before you submit your solution. You can invoke the unit tests from the command line at the root of your project folder:

    $ python -m unittest discover tests

You can also run these same tests using the `Test Explorer` extension built in to the VSCode editor, by enabling automatic test discovery.  This is a really useful tool and we highly recommend to learn it.

https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/testing#_test-discovery

- Test framework is `unittest`
- Test folder pattern is `tests`
- Test name pattern is `test*`

## Submitting your work
To submit your solution for grading, you will need to create a github [Pull Request (PR)](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests).  Refer to the `PR Workflow` article in your course content for details.
